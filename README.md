Another Frankenstein's monster of PHP, jquery and Python.  Searching texts on iPhones is surprisingly awful, so I made this to take a iMessage dump (performed using a 3rd party app), load it into a database and make it searchable and taggable.

This app is super far from complete.

To do:
1. Handle UTF-8 character encoding properly
1. Be able tag messages
1. Be able to manage tags (create/update/delete)
1. Be able to search by tags
1. Create a tag cloud
1. Create an autocomplete feature a la Google Search
1. Do some form of language sentiment analysis
